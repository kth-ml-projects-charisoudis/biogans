# Purpose
DD2402 Advanced Individual Course in Computational Biology Project.

# Subject
Implementation of Osokin et al. _GANs for Biological Image Synthesis_ ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04692)). In this project we try to (at least partially) implement the work presented in the paper.
We also extend the original work by testing smaller models and also using statistical testing to support our claim that one-class GANs perform superiorly to multi-class ones when it comes to the fidelity of the generated cellular evolution images.
